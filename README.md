# Project Readme

## Overview
Analysis of customer behavior, retention, and lifetime value for an e-commerce company to improve customer retention and maximize revenue.

## Business Questions
1. **Customer Segmentation:** Who are our most valuable customers?
2. **Cohort Analysis:** How do different customer groups generate long-term revenue?
3. **Retention Analysis:** Which customers haven't purchased recently?

## Analysis Approach

### 1. Customer Segmentation Analysis
- Categorized customers based on total lifetime value (LTV)
- Assigned customers to High, Mid, and Low-value segments
- Calculated key metrics: total revenue

📊 **Key Findings:**
- High-value segment (25% of customers) drives 66% of revenue ($135.4M)
- Mid-value segment (50% of customers) generates 32% of revenue ($66.6M)
- Low-value segment (25% of customers) accounts for 2% of revenue ($4.3M)

💡 **Business Insights**
- High-Value (66% revenue): Offer premium membership program to 12,372 VIP customers, as losing one customer significantly impacts revenue
- Mid-Value (32% revenue): Create upgrade paths through personalized promotions, with potential $66.6M → $135.4M revenue opportunity
- Low-Value (2% revenue): Design re-engagement campaigns and price-sensitive promotions to increase purchase frequency

### 2. Cohort-Based Analysis
- Tracked cumulative revenue per customer cohort
- Analyzed lifetime value trends
- Evaluated acquisition channel performance

- Holiday cohorts: 40% better retention

### 3. Retention Analysis
- Identified customers at risk of churning
- Analyzed last purchase patterns
- Calculated customer-specific metrics and warning indicators

🖥️ Query: [2.2_cohort_ltv_over_time.sql](2.2_cohort_ltv_over_time.sql)
